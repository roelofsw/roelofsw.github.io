Welcome to my first foray in many years into the blogging scene!  Please see the [about](http://{{ site.url }}/about.html) page for more details about this site.  This is partially an experiment on my end to publish details on some fun/interesting/useful things that I've done, but if it helps someone out there attempting similar things, it'll make it worth the time.

I'm still in the process of setting up the theme and related things on Github, but actual posts should be coming soon.  Some initial topics I'll be covering, include:

* Using a Raspberry Pi for fun and savings (hosting a number of personal cloud type services on minimal hardware - an ongoing series)
* Improved energy use logging using a Watts Clever energy meter and Raspberry Pi
* Overcoming Power over Ethernet distance issues while setting up IP cameras
* A python [trello](http://www.trello.com/) parser
