This investigation started off as a result of my frustration with the seemingly haphazzard nature of looking for work using multiple avenues (websites, recruiters, leads from friends, etc) and keeping track of documents submitted (resumes, code samples, cover letters, etc), and the lack of options available to deal with this dilemma.
 
When I say lack of options, it doesn't mean there are no options.  I've signed up for a [jibberjobber](http://www.jibberjobber.com) account, and by and large it looks like a good site.  But it means I have to figure out and learn something new, which won't have much use to me beyond the immediate need of finding a job.  Something like [trello](http://www.trello.com) or a self hosted [kanboard](http://kanboard.net) could work, but they don't display 'at a glance' the information I'd like to see.

Then I started writing my series of articles on self-hosting applications on a Raspberry Pi, and got re-acquainted with [RedMine](http://www.redmine.org).  Even though I'm a Jira fan, the inability of that to run on a Pi may have been fortuitous.  With a bit of tweaking, it turns out that RedMine is actually a really good way of keeping track of job application statii.  Beyond that, it has mobile clients available, and with a VPN (or hosted on a VPS), I have easy secure access to all my information, anywhere.  Oh, and of course it's free and open source :)

So, without trying to convince anyone of the merits first, I'll show you what I've done, and you can decide for yourself if it's worthwhile.

First, you'll need a copy of RedMine running.  I'll be writing an article on that in the near future, but for the moment, you can use their website as a reference.  It runs on a multitude of platforms, and in short, you'll need to do the following:
