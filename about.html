    <h1>About flintbox.me</h1>
    <p>This blog is intended to host posts and articles about things I've done (usually in some way that I hadn't seen done elsewhere), or simply things I find interesting or useful (sometimes even both!).</p>
    <p>My interests are wide-ish, but the blog will likely be focussed on electronics, software, and related topics.  While I enjoy DIY work around the house, I doubt that many people are interested in different approaches to reseating slate tiles ;-)</p>
    <p><b><i>Why flintbox?</i></b></p>
    <p>The blog name refers to a tool used for starting a fire, which is in many way the underpinning of modern society.  My lofty goal on this blog is to provide information about tools, ideas and processes that make other (interesting/useful) things possible.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to use the comments sections in posts to let me know whether I'm achieving this (or not ;-) )!</p>
