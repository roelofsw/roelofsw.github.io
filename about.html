    <h1>About flintbox.me</h1>
    <p>This blog is intended to host posts and articles about things I've done (usually in some way that I hadn't seen done elsewhere), or simply things I find interesting or useful (sometimes even both!).  My interests are wide-ish, but the blog will likely be focussed on electronics, software, and related topics.  While I enjoy DIY work around the house, I doubt that many people are interested in different approaches to reseating slate tiles ;-)</p>
    <p>The blog name refers to a device used for starting a fire.  Fire is in many way the underpinning of modern society, and my lofty goal here is to provide information about tools and ideas that make other (interesting) things possible.</p>
